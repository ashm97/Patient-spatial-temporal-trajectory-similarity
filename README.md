# Revealing missed transmission in hospital outbreaks of disease with a novel contact recovery mode

We introduce a novel contact model which recovers undetected transmission of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Outbreaks of HAIs are both burdensome and extremely common. Contact tracing based on direct contacts is often used in outbreaks HAIs to prevent further spread. However, missing and indirect contacts pose severely limit contact tracing and result in misleading conclusions. Here, we propose a graph-based model to mitigate these problems by measuring proximity between network-constrained temporal trajectories across background movement patterns. Our model naturally captures already known, but also missed contact likely to have resulted in transmission. We showcase our models ability to capture transmission routes in an outbreak of HAI between 116 hospital patients, then demonstrate its real-time deployment on a cohort of 863 hospital patients. Using a semi-supervised learning framework, and bio-markers obtained from Whole Genome Sequencing, we show that our model reveals missing patient interactions that improve characterisation of disease transmission.
